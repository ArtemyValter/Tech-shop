                    seeking a minimalist setup without compromising functionality.
                    Its reduced size frees up valuable desk space, providing more room for mouse movements,

                    dedicated arrow keys, and the numpad. While this design saves space,
                    it may require an adjustment period for users accustomed to full-sized keyboards.
                    However,secondary functions are accessible via the 'Fn' key,
